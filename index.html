            Hi my name is Ryan and writing about sections is hard so I'm going to stop now.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Why does your website look so.. um.. yeah?<br>
            Good question person I made up. <a href="https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW" target="_blank">@Sara Vieira</a> make this awesome site,
            <a href="https://makefrontendshitagain.party/" target="_blank">makefrontendshitagain.party</a> so bandwagon and such. Seriously though
            it was just for fun. The internet was pretty cool before it became all import and proper.
        </p>
        <p>
            The big problem now is that I need to add some projects too prove everything I build isn't like this.
            Luckily the dope geocities under construction banner means I can put this off for a while.
